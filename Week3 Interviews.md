Name: Jingwei Song

Phone: N/A

1. No.
2. I’ll be graduating this year. I’m going to grad school after graduation and I’m not sure which
   program I’ll be going to. So I don’t have a plan for housing for now.
3. It’s hard to say. With on-campus housing you get to eat in the dining halls and you usually
   don’t have to walk far to the classrooms. But off campus housing there’s usually much more
   space. So I don't have a preference I guess.
4. I don’t have a car so 20 mins by walking.
5. Yes, as we tend to have similar habits and schedules.
6. Similar. I think there would tend to be fewer conflicts if you live with someone similar to
   you.
7. I like living with others because I like having friends around. But I prefer living in a room
   alone.
8. I would say distance to campus and safety.

Phone: N/A

1. I found my apartment by using the app Zillow.
2. I’ll start working full-time after graduation this April. Probably will renew my current lease or
   find some housing closer to work.
3. I do prefer off campus housing so that I can cook my own food, and there’s generally more
   space than on campus housing.
4. 15 minutes by car
5. I do prefer someone from the same country, because I had a bad experience living with
   someone from a different country during my freshmen year as we had drastically different habits
   and it’s hard for us to adjust to each other’s schedules.
6. Similar. I think the reason is quite similar to my answer to the last question.
7. Living alone as there’s much more freedom. You don’t have to inform your roommate of
   everything that you plan to do.
8. Distance to campus.

1. How far is your apartmentfrom school? How is the environment around the apartment? What are the roomtype in your apartment? What are favorite room type for international student?

   The apartment is about 15 minutes-walking tothe school. The neighborhood is pretty safe and the police station is closed tothe apartment. We constructed the apartment to have most of the rooms comingwith two bedroom and two bath rooms. Most international students prefer to havetheir own room and bath room.

2. How many present oftenant are international student? When are the empty housing available?  How long will it take to lease an empty roomduring this period? 

   100% of tenant are international student. Wewill have the empty spot during the school vacation like winter break or summerbreak. It will usually take 10 days to lease empty room.

3. In what way do you thinkmy app can help your business? Can you think of any shortcomings of our app? 

You app can actually help tome get a new tenant faster. I think having the furniture ready before theinternational student arrives is a good idea since most of them don’t owe a carat the beginning. 

But I have one concern. Youapp provide one-time housing service for incoming international student. Theywill use your app one time and then they may ditch your app. Once they are familiarwith the neighborhood, they will go behind your app to find room themselves.

1. Do you usually drivearound the airport area? Who are your primary customer? 

No, I don’t go around theairport that much.

Yes. I usually pick upcustomer around UCLA and USC. My primary customer are student.

1. Do you think my app canhelp you gain more customers by arranging airport pickup for international student?

No. you app may reduce the numberof customers for a specific period. If I am using your app to get customer, it will limit to pick up a specific person at a specific time. If the flight werelate, I can’t afford to just wait for that specific person the airport. Duringthe time I am waiting, I may also have customers want to go somewhere else. Whywould I not picking up other customers but waiting for you? Will thisinternational student pay a real high price for the pick up? We don’t know.



##Below are the initial analysis by Kevin Qian

My first two interview reveals the following points:

1. People living on campus may still have chances living off campus for various reasons (if convenience are satisfied, and based on information I know, there are housing locations even closer to campus compare to that of dorms)
2. One of the obstacles (Customer Pain) has been lack of referable resources of off-campus housing information (they do not know there are such housing resources mentioned in the first point)
3. International students from China generally prefer living with students from the same country and usually prefer to have roommate with similar interest, background, lifestyle, etc. (thus roommate search becomes necessary)
4. Convenience and Safety are two important aspects that would impact choice of house rental
