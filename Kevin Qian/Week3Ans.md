A.
(First-year international student)
Name: Martin Shen
Phone: 424-355-5561

1. Yes
2. Staying on campus. Because I do not really like to spend time and effort on searching for apartment rental information
3. On campus, because it is super convenient and I can even head back to my dorm to take a nap between classes
4. 10 miles
5. Yes
6. Similar, because I won't be easily disturbed since we share a similar lifestyle
7. Living with others. And I prefer sharing room with others, at most two roommates
8. Safety is the most important problem

B.
(Second-year international student)
Name: Qingyi Zhao
Phone: 424-371-0108

1. Yes
2. Staying on campus. Because both have similar expenses, while living on campus is more convenient (easy access to dining halls, gym and libraries)
3. Off campus. But if not considering financial issues, I would prefer on campus
4. A distance of 10-15 minute walk
5. It depends. Language and culture is the reason I would like such roommates, but I also need to practice English
6. Similar, because they would be easier to communicate. Also sharing similar interests and lifestyle, so they are comfortable to live with.
7. Prefer living with other in a style that each having an individual bedroom, while sharing a common living room. And I prefer a maximum of two roommates
8. Convenience (to campus, to restaurants or dining halls, to gym and to libraries)

Analysis:
My first two interview reveals the following points:
1. People living on campus may still have chances living off campus for various reasons (if convenience are satisfied, and based on information I know, there are housing locations even closer to campus compare to that of dorms)
2. One of the obstacles (Customer Pain) has been lack of referable resources of off-campus housing information (they do not know there are such housing resources mentioned in the first point)
3. International students from China generally prefer living with students from the same country and usually prefer to have roommate with similar interest, background, lifestyle, etc. (thus roommate search becomes necessary)
4. Convenience and Safety are two important aspects that would impact choice of house rental
